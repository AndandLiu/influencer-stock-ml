# Required Libraries

- googleapiclient
- yfinance
- TextBlob

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip] to install the required libraries.

```bash
pip3 install google-api-python-client
pip3 install yfinance
pip3 install textblob
```

## Generating files
The steps to generate the files are numbered.\
All the CSV files generated by steps 1-4 were moved to a folder called intermediate_files.\
The files generated by step 5 were moved to their respective company folders (google, apple and microsoft).\

###
All these steps require the program to make requests to the Youtube API and can result in exceeding the daily limits set by Google. If this happens then a new API key has to be generated through the Google Cloud Platform or have to wait 24 hours.

### Step 1
Get youtube videos for any search query.

```bash
python3 1_get_youtube_videos.py 'xbox'
```

### Step 2
Get youtube channel data for all the videos returned by step 1.

```bash
python3 2_get_youtube_channel.py 'xbox'
```

### Step 3
Get youtube video stats data for all the videos returned by step 1.

```bash
python3 3_get_youtube_video_stats.py 'xbox'
```

### Step 4
Get youtube comments data and run sentiment analysis for all the videos returned by step 1.\
**WARNING**: This step will take a long time and will likely use up the daily Youtube API request limit.

```bash
python3 4_get_youtube_comments.py 'xbox'
```

### Step 5
Merge and clean the data

```bash
python3 5_clean_youtube_data.py 'xbox'
```

## Statistical Analysis
Run statistical analysis (this step requires that the google, apple and microsoft folders are present)

```bash
python3 youtube_stock_analysis.py
```

## Machine Learning
Run Machine Learning classifier for a specified folder (apple or google or microsoft)

```bash
python3 youtube_stock_ml_classifier.py apple
```

Run Machine Learning regressor for a specified folder (apple or google or microsoft)

```bash
python3 youtube_stock_ml_regressor.py apple
```
